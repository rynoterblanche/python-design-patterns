## Factories
 - encapsulates object instantiation
 - supports DI (dependency inversion)
 - clients depend on abstraction rather than details of implementation

## Simple Factory Pattern

- one factory
- often all you need

## Classic (Full) Factory Pattern

- one or more factories
- return an instance of an object factory to create your object
- more flexible, extensible option
