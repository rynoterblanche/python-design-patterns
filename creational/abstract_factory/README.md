## Abstract Factory

- a close cousin to factory:
    - encapsulates object instantiation
    - supports dependency inversion
    - clients can call to an abstraction
- creates a family of classes
- enforces dependencies between concrete classes
- defers object creation to concrete subclasses
- also known as the Kit pattern

## Factory vs Abstract Factory

- factory is great when you don't know which classes you will need
- abstract factory is good for working with families of objects
- choosing one over the other also depends very much on what you are trying to achieve!
